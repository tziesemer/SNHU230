• Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

This software is a game called Draw it or Lose it. That was requested by The Gaming room. They wanted a game where images were shown for 30 seconds followed by a 15 second window for the current player up to guess the word the images are related to. This game was to be built for multiple players in teams with only one instance of each game open at a time that all the players interacted with.

• What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When developing this design document, I got through detailing the requirements and design constraints quickly as I have an easy time with straight data.

• What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Those same requirements and design constraints helped me immensely when I was developing the initial code for some of the games software. It did this by narrowing down which design patterns would work best. With that I could get the code done much faster than building everything from scratch.

• If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would take more time to really understand all the major operating system options so that I could give a better overview of each one for the evaluation section of the document. In my preliminary searches I found that a lot of the differences were minimal but when I dived deeper for the recommendations I found a few new things about Linux and realized with a deep enough dive I might find more impactful differences with the other operating systems too.

• How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

After getting the paper describing what the user needed I created the requirements and design constraints. This formed a basic framework for the software design. These left and right limits as well as goal posts ensure that the end product is what the user needs and wants. If you ignore the user’s needs when designing, you are just wasting your time and effort. Just doing a project how you see fit will usually lead to a product that isn’t needed or wanted or that has unnecessary features while missing needed ones. In the end you must fix it or lose the project and someone else will have to fix it.

• How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I used to be more off the cuff with my designs as I have always been. I think going forward I will start to at least use the design documents format of getting user request, creating requirements and limitations, choosing appropriate design patterns, evaluating different options thoroughly, and then given recommendations to the team and client before making final decisions.
